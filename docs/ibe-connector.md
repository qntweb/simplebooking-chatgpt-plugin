# SimpleBooking IBE connector

Read-only access to the SimpleBooking booking engine (IBE) for the hotels a user
manages: property content, availability, prices and area demand.

## Who can use it

Anyone with a SimpleBooking Back Office account. Signing in grants access only to the
properties that account is authorised for by each property; the connector cannot reach
any other hotel.

## What data it returns

Most of what this connector returns is what any traveller already sees on the
property's public booking engine: descriptions, photos, room types, rates, offers,
packages, services and the availability calendar. On top of that it adds two kinds of
aggregated data:

- **Area demand** — the number of searches travellers ran on booking engines for stays
  around the property, grouped by date, length of stay, party size, country of origin
  or device. Counts only: no individual search and no traveller identity.
- **OTA price comparison** — for properties with Rate Match enabled, the prices the
  same stay is sold at on online travel agencies, which are public prices.

The connector never returns guest names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone
numbers or payment details.
